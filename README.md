## Build
To build our our code simply run the file through the command line without any additional arguments

## Usage
Make use to have the test cases that you want to run in the same directory as the program itself. Additionally, you need 3 other directories in the same directory as the program, named: Screenshots_gui, Screenshots_graphs and Gifs. These are there to save the screenshots of the GUI to generate the GIFs that are then saved in the Gifs folder. As for the screenshots_graphs folder, this is there to save the graphs of the test case results. 
To run the code the user just simply inputs the testcase.txt file and presses ENTER. The program will do the rest.
Enjoy.
